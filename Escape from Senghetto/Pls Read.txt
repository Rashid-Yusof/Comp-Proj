For some reason program cannot import items from
finalmap, so I copy pasted the code into
map.py.

I'm not really sure if the program will work without either files,
so just don't delete anything lol.

But if you want to make changes to the map or items,
make changes to map.py and finalItems.py respectively.

TO-DO:
1) Endings(draft)
-> 'didn't hide body' ending failed

2) sell laptop event
-> need to add condition that guy is there

3) optional: Colored text to make things more readable.

4) shop bug: buying wand does not deduct money

5) ending descriptions print improperly

Suggestions:
1) Reduce amount of items/make items usable for puzzles

*You can add more things here if we missed something!
